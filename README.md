    npm install
    ```
    or if you use yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the project root.
    * Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if you have one) or add the following variables with your Appwrite IDs:
        ```env
        VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT="[https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1](https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1)" # Or your Appwrite endpoint
        VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
        VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID="YOUR_DATABASE_ID"
        VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID_DAILY_CARDS="YOUR_DAILY_CARDS_COLLECTION_ID"
        VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID_SUPPORT_PLANS="YOUR_SUPPORT_PLANS_COLLECTION_ID"
        VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID_GRATITUDE_ENTRIES="YOUR_GRATITUDE_ENTRIES_COLLECTION_ID"
        VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID_FUTURE_ME_LETTERS="YOUR_FUTURE_ME_LETTERS_COLLECTION_ID"
        VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID_USER_PREFERENCES="YOUR_USER_PREFERENCES_COLLECTION_ID"
        ```

4.  **Start the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
    The application should be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port Vite assigns).

5.  **Appwrite Cloud Project Configuration:**
    * Ensure you have a project created in [Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/).
    * **Authentication:** Enable the Email/Password method.
    * **Database:** Create a database and the following collections with the attributes and permissions specified in the detailed project documentation (if available, otherwise define as needed):

    * **Platforms:** Add a web platform for local development (e.g., Hostname: `localhost`) and another for your deployed site (e.g., Hostname: `myinnerrefuge.netlify.app`).

## üèóÔ∏è Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the dist/ folder with optimized static files, ready to be deployed on any static site hosting platform.

üåê Deployment
This application is optimized for easy deployment on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or Firebase Hosting.

For Netlify (Recommended):

Push your code to a GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository.
Connect your repository to Netlify.
Build Settings:
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: dist
Add your environment variables (those from the .env file) in Netlify's site configuration.
Create a _redirects file in your project's root (or public folder that gets copied to dist) with the content: /* /index.html 200 for correct SPA routing.
Ensure you add the Netlify domain (e.g., your-site.netlify.app) to your Appwrite project's "Platforms."
